# Insurance Cost Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting insurance charges using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the "insurance.csv" dataset and involves data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, model selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and model evaluation.

## Introduction

In this project, I aim to predict insurance charges based on various features using machine learning. The dataset used is "insurance.csv," and the project involves the following steps:

- Data analysis and initial exploration
- Data visualization to understand relationships between rows
- Data preprocessing including encoding and normalization, scaling
- Model selection and training with various regression algorithms
- Hyper-parameter optimization using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "insurance.csv," which contains information about individuals and their insurance charges.


## Model Performance

The selected model is trained on the data and tested on a hold-out test set. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
