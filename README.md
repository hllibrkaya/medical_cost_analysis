# Insurance Cost Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting insurance charges using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the "insurance.csv" dataset and involves data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, model selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and model evaluation.

## Introduction

In this project, I aim to predict insurance charges based on various features using machine learning. The dataset used is "insurance.csv," and the project involves the following steps:

- Data analysis and initial exploration
- Data visualization to understand relationships between rows
- Data preprocessing including encoding and normalization, scaling
- Model selection and training with various regression algorithms
- Hyper-parameter optimization using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "insurance.csv," which contains information about individuals and their insurance charges.


## Model Performance

After training and evaluating the predictive model, I achieved the following performance results:

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: 1.3593
- **R2 (Coefficient of Determination)**: 0.9999999866
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: 0.9431
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: 1.1659
- **Explained Variance**: 0.9999999866

These performance metrics indicate that the model provides highly accurate predictions with minimal errors. The R2 score close to 1 suggests that the model explains the variability in the data exceptionally well. The low values of MAE, RMSE, and MSE further confirm the model's strong predictive capabilities.
